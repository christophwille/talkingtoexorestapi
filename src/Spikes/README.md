This spike references DLLs from https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/ (simply do a manual download, 
change extension to zip & extract - do not forget to Unblock zip first!) and then uses the public classes Container and Mailbox to 
send a DataServiceQuery to the REST endpoint. 

Was a PoC to see if that can be done at all.
